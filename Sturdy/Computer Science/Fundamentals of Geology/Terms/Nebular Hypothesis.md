Was first formulated in 1755 by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant in his treatise Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels (Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens).

Kant suggested that at the origin, the solar system consisted of a rotating cloud of gases and fine dust called the nebular hypothesis. 

Kantâ€™s hypothesis was based, although not correcty, on the laws of Newton. It was corrected in 1796 by the French mathematician Laplace.

The fomration of solar system by theory:
1) The diffuse, slowly rotating nebula contracted under the forces of gravity
2) Its contraction, in turn, accelerated the rotation of the particles, and the faster rotation flattened the cloud into a disk
3) Under the pull of gravity, matter began to drift toward the center of the nebula, accumulating into a protostar, the precursor of the Sun
4) Although most of the matter in the original nebula was concentrated in the proto-Sun, a disk of gases and dust, called the solar nebula, remained to envelop it ... Gravitational attraction caused the dust and condensing material to clump together (accrete) into small, kilometer-sized chunks, or planetesimals
5) These planetesimals, in turn, collided and stuck together, forming larger, Moon-sized bodies. In a final stage of cataclysmic impacts, a few of these larger bodies swept up the others to form the planets in their present orbits.
