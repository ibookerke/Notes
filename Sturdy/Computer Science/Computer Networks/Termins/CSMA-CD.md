## CSMA - carrier sense multiple access
## CD - Collision detection


 CSMA/CD: carrier sensing, deferral as in CSMA
	  - collisions detected within short time 
	  - colliding transmissions aborted, reducing channel wastage
- collision detection:
	- easy in wired LANs: measure signal strengths, compare transmitted, received signals
	- difficult in wireless LANs: received signal strength overwhelmed by local transmission strength
