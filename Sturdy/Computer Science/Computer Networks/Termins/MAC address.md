MAC(Media Access Control)

Also called LAN/Ethernet/physical address


32-bit IP address
- network-layer address for interface 
- used for layer 3 (network layer) forwarding

48-bit MAC Address
- function: used ‘locally” to get frame from one interface to another physically connected interface (same network, in IP-addressing sense) 
- 48 bit MAC address (for most [[LAN]]s) burned in [[NIC]] ROM, also sometimes software settable 
- e.g.: 1A-2F-BB-76-09-AD (hexadecimal (base 16) notation (each “numeral” represents 4 bits))
