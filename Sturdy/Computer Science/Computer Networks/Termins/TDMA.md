- Channel partitioning MAC protocol
- Stands for ==time division multiple access== 


 - access to channel in "rounds" 
 - each station gets fixed length slot (length = packet transmission time) in each round 
 - unused slots go idle 
 - example: 6-station LAN, 1,3,4 have packets to send, slots 2,5,6 idle
