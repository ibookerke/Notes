<h2>Requirements Engineering</h2> 
The process of establishing the services that acustomer requires from a system and the constraints under which it operates and is developed.
<h3>Types of Requirements</h3>
**User Requirements** - statements in natural language plus diagrams of the services the system provides and its operational constraints. Written for customers.

**System Requirements** - A structured document setting out detailed descriptions of the systemâ€™s functions, services and operational constraints. Defines what should be implemented so may be part of a contract between client and contractor.
<h3>System StakeHolders</h3>
Any person or organization who is affected by the system in some way and so who has a legitimate interest.

**Stakeholder type:**
- End users
- System managers
- System owners
- External stakeholders

<h2>Functional and non-functional requirements</h2>
**Functional** - statements of services the system should provide, how the system should react to particular inputs and how the system should behave in particular situations. May state what the system should not do.

**Non-Functional** - constrains of system functions and services. Such as standarts, timing constraints.

**Domain requirements** - constrains on the system from the domain of operation.

**Non-functional classification:**
**Product requirements** - specify that the delivered product must behave in a particular way e.g. execution speed, reliability, etc.

**Organisational requirements** - a consequence of organisational policies and procedures e.g. process standards used, implementation requirements, etc.

**External requirements** arise from factors which are external to the system and its development process e.g. interoperability requirements, legislative requirements, etc.

<h3>RE processes</h3>
- **Requirements elicitation** - requirement discovery process that involves [[Stakeholders]] and technical staff working with customers. It includes
	- Requirements discovery
	- Requirements classification and organisation
	- Prioritisation and negotiation
- **Requirements analysis** - 
- **Requirements validation** - 
- **Requirements management** -
