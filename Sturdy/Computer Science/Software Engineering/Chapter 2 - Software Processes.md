<h2>Software process involes:</h1>
-   Specification – defining what the system should do
-   Design and implementation – defining the organization of the system and implementing the system
-   Validation – checking that it does what the customer wants
-   Evolution – changing the system in response to changing customer needs

<h3>Software process types:</h3>
**Plan Driven**
-   Pprocesses where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan. 
-   Requires detailed documentation

**Agile**
-   In agile processes, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements. 


<h3>Software process models:</h3>
**Waterfall model**
-   Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development

-   The main drawback of the waterfall model is the difficulty of accommodating change after the process is underway. In principle, a phase has to be complete before moving onto the next phase


**Incremental development**
-   Specification, development and validation are interleaved. May be plan-driven or agile.
-   based on the idea of developing an initial implementation, getting feedback from users and others, and evolving the software through several versions until the required system has been developed
-   rapid feedback across activities
-   Cheaper to make changes
-   The process is not visible(hard to monitor progress)
-   System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added(if no refactor)


**Integration and configuration**
-   The system is assembled from existing configurable components. May be plan-driven or agile
-   Based on software reuse where systems are integrated from existing components or application systems 
-   Reused elements may be configured to adapt their behaviour and functionality to a user’s requirements
-   reduced amount of software to be developed and so reducing cost and risks
-   some control over the system evolution is lost when using components of other systems

<h3>Integration and configuration process stages:</h3>
- **Requirements proposing** - Proposing initial requirements, brief description of requirements and system features
- **Software discovery and evaluation** - search for components satisfying our requirements
- **Requirements refinement** - refining and modifying requirements by anayzing discovered components and their available features. 
- **Application system configuration** - If an off-the-shelf application system that meets the requirements is available, it may then be configured for use to create the new system
- **Component adaptation and integration** - If there is no off-the-shelf system, individual reusable components may be modified and new components developed
