BIOS (basic input/output system) isÂ **the program a computer's microprocessor uses to start the computer system after it is powered on**. It also manages data flow between the computer's operating system (OS) and attached devices, such as the hard disk, video adapter, keyboard, mouse and printer.

It is responsible for:
- initialization the hardware (POST) and loading some very basic drivers
- gives hand to the bootloader located at the [[MBR]]
