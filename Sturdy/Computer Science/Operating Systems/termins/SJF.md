### Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
- Associate with each process the length of its next CPU burst
	- Use these lengths to schedule the process with the shortest time
- SJF is optimal â€“ gives ==minimum average waiting== time for a given set of processes
	- The difficulty is knowing the length of the next CPU request

There also a ==preemptive== implementation, when we are reassiging CPU during runtime on process arrival.

turnaround time = completion time - arrival time
waiting time = turnaround time - burst time 
Response time = Time at which the process gets the CPU for the first time - Arrival time
