## We are continuing observing scheduling algorithms:
- ### [[Priority scheduling]]
- ### [[Round Robin]]
- ### [[Multilevel Feedback Queue]]

## Quantum and Context Switching

## Thread Scheduling
- Distinction between user-level and kernel-level threads 
- process-contention scope (PCS) : scheduling competition is within the process 
- Kernel thread scheduled onto available CPU is system-contention scope (SCS) â€“ competition among all threads in system 
	- E.g., one-to-one model such as Linux and Windows
