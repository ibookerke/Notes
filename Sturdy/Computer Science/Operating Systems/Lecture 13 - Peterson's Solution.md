- It is a classic software-based solution to the [[Critical Section Problem]]
- May not work on the modern computer architectures
- However, it provides a good algorithmic description of solving the critical section problem and illustrates some of the complexities involved in designing software that addresses the requirement of mutual exclusion, progress, and bounded waiting requirements.
- This solution is restricted to two processes that alternate execution between their critical-sections and remainder-sections.
Let there are 2 processes:
Pi and 
Pj

### Mutual Exclusion Locks
- [[Acquire and Release Lock]]s
- [[Test and Set Lock]]
