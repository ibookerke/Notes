- depended and [[Independent Vectors]]

- [[Linear transformation]]
  The matrix of a linear transformation is **a matrix for which T(→x)=A→x, for a vector →x in the domain of T**. ==This means that applying the transformation T to a vector is the same as multiplying by this matrix.==

- Determinant of matrix is just an area that is covered by its [[Linear transformation]]
