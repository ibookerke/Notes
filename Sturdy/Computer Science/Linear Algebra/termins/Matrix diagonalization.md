  
**The conversion of a matrix into diagonal form**Â is called diagonalization. The [[Eigenvalue]]s of a matrix are clearly represented by diagonal matrices. A Diagonal Matrix is a square matrix in which all of the elements are zero except the principal diagonal elements.

A - matrix
It is not possible if A has too few [[Eigenvector]] or if A is rectangular
