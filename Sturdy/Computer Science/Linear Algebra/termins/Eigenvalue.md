Eigenvalues are **the special set of scalar values that is associated with the set of linear equations most probably in the matrix equations**. The eigenvectors are also termed as characteristic roots. It is a non-zero vector that can be changed at most by its scalar factor after the application of linear transformations.

The number λ is an eigenvalue of A iff A- λI is singular:
$$ det(A - λI) = 0 $$

So we have a matrix A and we have a vector x. x will be an [[Eigenvector]] of A if 
	det(A - λI) = 0 
, where λ is a eigenvalue
