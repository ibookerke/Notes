In linear algebra, an eigenvector or characteristic vector of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes at most by a constant factor when that linear transformation is applied to it.

The eigenvector is **a vector that is associated with a set of linear equations**. The eigenvector of a matrix is also known as a latent vector, proper vector, or characteristic vector.

So we have a matrix A and we have a vector x. x will be an eigenvector of A if 
	det(A - λI) = 0
, where λ is a [[Eigenvalue]]
