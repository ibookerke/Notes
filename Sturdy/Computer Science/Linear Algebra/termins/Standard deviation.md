A standard deviation (or σ) is **a measure of how dispersed the data is in relation to the [[Mean]]**.


A low standard [deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviation_(statistics) "Deviation (statistics)") indicates that the values tend to be close to the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean "Mean") (also called the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value")) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

Standard deviation is a square root of [[Variance]]
