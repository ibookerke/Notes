There are 2 types of variables

Discrete and Continuous

Discrete 
Continuous


Model - transforms the data
Objective function - decides how good our model is(like utility function)
Algorithm adjusts the parameters for objective functions

In ML we try to discover patterns
The question is to decide whether the pattern found is legit or it is just memorizing data outcomes.

Understanding vs memorizing

We are trying to build understanding: generalization 

One way of estimating the it is using generalization error
We cannot calculate all the data and say everything but we can calculate training error or validatiion error. 

Underfitting - model is not complex enough
Overfitting - model will fit into noise of a data

If we are unsure we are likely to choose a simpler model

Cross validtion
- choose part of data 
- train model on it
- try this model on other other part of data that ==doesn't overlap== training data



good for model evaluation or for the modal selection
