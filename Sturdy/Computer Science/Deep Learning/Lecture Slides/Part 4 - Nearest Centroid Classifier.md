Then for a new data x desired to be classified we check if x is more similar to µ_o

$$ ||µ_∆ − x|| > ||µ_o − x|| $$
## Nearest centroid classification features

- Prototypes are often chosen as the class-centroids 
- Centroids can be estimated iteratively from data streams 
- Memory-efficient for large-scale data sets 

Why? Only centroids need to be stored Data points can be deleted after updates
