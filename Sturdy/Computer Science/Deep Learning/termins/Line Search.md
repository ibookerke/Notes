In optimization, the **line search** strategy is one of two basic iterative approaches to find a local minimum of an [[objective function]].

The line search approach first finds a [descent direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descent_direction "Descent direction") along which the objective function f will be reduced and then computes a step size that determines how far X should move along that direction. The descent direction can be computed by various methods, such as [[Gradient descent]]. The step size can be determined either exactly or inexactly.
