Activation function of a node in an artificial neural network is **a function that calculates the output of the node** (based on its inputs and the weights on individual inputs). Nontrivial problems can be solved only using a nonlinear activation function.


**A weighted sum of inputs is passed through an [[Activation function]] and this output serves as an input to the next layer**.

- differentiable operators for transforming input signals to outputs
