Just a way to represent categorical data in binary format

1. Take the data distinct values
2. Map an index for each value
3. Represent the data as a row of zeros with the 1 integer at the index of corresponding value

For instance:
We have 5 countries:
Russia - 1, China - 2, USA - 3, Kazakhstan - 4, Japan - 5
So Russia will be 10000
China - 01000
Kazakhstan - 00010
