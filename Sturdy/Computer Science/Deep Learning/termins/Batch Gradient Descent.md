it is a type of [[Gradient descent]] that takes the entire dataset and train model on it

### Features:
- hard to compute (almost impossible to use on large datasets)
- believed to be fast(but not necessarily)
- in majority of scenarios is worse solution in comparison with [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]]
