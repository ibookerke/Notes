In mathematics, the Hessian matrix, Hessian or (less commonly) Hesse matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, or scalar field. ItÂ **describes the local curvature of a function of many variables**.

# Hessian matrix's connection to function form:
- `f(x1, x2, ..., xn)` is [[convex function]] iff its `n*n` Hessian matrix is ==positive semidefinite== for all possible values  of `(x1, x2, ..., xn)`

- `f(x1, x2, ..., xn)` is not  [[convex function]] iff its `n*n` Hessian matrix is ==negative semidefinite== for all possible values  of `(x1, x2, ..., xn)`


Hessian matrix is ==positive semidefinite== if the scalar
$$ z^T * H * z $$
is ==non-negative== for every non-zero column vector z of n real numbers. 


Hessian matrix is ==negative semidefinite== if the scalar
$$ z^T * H * z $$
is ==negative== for every non-zero column vector z of n real numbers. 


Example:
