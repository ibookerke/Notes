**Factory Method** is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


Imagine that you’re creating a logistics management application. The first version of your app can only handle transportation by trucks, so the bulk of your code lives inside the `Truck` class.

After a while, your app becomes pretty popular. Each day you receive dozens of requests from sea transportation companies to incorporate sea logistics into the app.


At present, most of your code is coupled to the `Truck` class. Adding `Ships` into the app would require making changes to the entire codebase. Moreover, if later you decide to add another type of transportation to the app, you will probably need to make all of these changes again.

As a result, you will end up with pretty nasty code, riddled with conditionals that switch the app’s behavior depending on the class of transportation objects.

The Factory Method pattern suggests that you replace direct object construction calls (using the `new` operator) with calls to a special _factory_ method. Don’t worry: the objects are still created via the `new` operator, but it’s being called from within the factory method. Objects returned by a factory method are often referred to as _products._

```Java
// The creator class declares the factory method that must
// return an object of a product class. The creator's subclasses
// usually provide the implementation of this method.
class Dialog is
    // The creator may also provide some default implementation
    // of the factory method.
    abstract method createButton():Button

    // Note that, despite its name, the creator's primary
    // responsibility isn't creating products. It usually
    // contains some core business logic that relies on product
    // objects returned by the factory method. Subclasses can
    // indirectly change that business logic by overriding the
    // factory method and returning a different type of product
    // from it.
    method render() is
        // Call the factory method to create a product object.
        Button okButton = createButton()
        // Now use the product.
        okButton.onClick(closeDialog)
        okButton.render()

// Concrete creators override the factory method to change the
// resulting product's type.
class WindowsDialog extends Dialog is
    method createButton():Button is
        return new WindowsButton()

class WebDialog extends Dialog is
    method createButton():Button is
        return new HTMLButton()

// The product interface declares the operations that all
// concrete products must implement.
interface Button is
    method render()
    method onClick(f)

// Concrete products provide various implementations of the
// product interface.
class WindowsButton implements Button is
    method render(a, b) is
        // Render a button in Windows style.
    method onClick(f) is
        // Bind a native OS click event.

class HTMLButton implements Button is
    method render(a, b) is
        // Return an HTML representation of a button.
    method onClick(f) is
        // Bind a web browser click event.

class Application is
    field dialog: Dialog

    // The application picks a creator's type depending on the
    // current configuration or environment settings.
    method initialize() is
        config = readApplicationConfigFile()

        if (config.OS == "Windows") then
            dialog = new WindowsDialog()
        else if (config.OS == "Web") then
            dialog = new WebDialog()
        else
            throw new Exception("Error! Unknown operating system.")

    // The client code works with an instance of a concrete
    // creator, albeit through its base interface. As long as
    // the client keeps working with the creator via the base
    // interface, you can pass it any creator's subclass.
    method main() is
        this.initialize()
        dialog.render()
```
