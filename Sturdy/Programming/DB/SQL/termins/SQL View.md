Basically view is a certain precompiled select statement. SQL stores the logic that was performed to make a select statement as a virtual table. When someone calls the view - it performs the query and returns result.

In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.

You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.

A view is created with the `CREATE VIEW` statement.
