2<h2>Agile development</h2>
 - Program specification, design and implementation are inter-leaved 
 - The system is developed as a series of versions or increments with stakeholders involved in version specification and evaluation 
 - Frequent delivery of new versions for evaluation 
 - Extensive tool support (e.g. automated testing tools) used to support development. 
 - Minimal documentation – focus on working code

<h3>Agile Development Techniques</h3>
**Extreme Programming**
- A very influential agile method, developed in the late 1990s, that introduced a range of agile development techniques.
- Extreme Programming (XP) takes an ‘extreme’ approach to iterative development.
	- New versions may be built several times per day; 
	- Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks; 
	- All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully.

<h4>Main principleso of Extreme Programming</h4>
- **Incremental planning** - Requirements are recorded on story cards and the stories to be
included in a release are determined by the time available and their relative priority.
- **Small releases** - Releases of the system are frequent and incrementally add functionality to the first release
- **Test-first development** - extensive testing on each iteration
- **Refactoring** - regular asap reffactoring
- **Pair programming** - developers work in paies checlinf each other's work and do support
- **Collective ownership** - Working paris are working on all areas of the system instead of focusing on certain part in order to be ingterchangeable.
- **Continuous integration** - as soon as the work on a task is complete in is being integrated.
- **Sustainable pace** - preventing large amount of overtime working
- **On-site customer** - in all processes there should be a ens-user representative that is highly involved in all the processes.

<h3>Agile Project Management - SCRUM</h3>
**Scrum** - an agile method that focuses on managing iterative development rather than specific agile practices.

There are 3 phases
1) Outline planning - establish the general objectives for the project and design the software architecture
2) Sprint Cycles - each development cycle - increment of a system 
3) Project Clousure - wraps up the project and completes required documentation

<h4>Scrum Terminology</h4>
**Product backlog** - This is a list of ‘to do’ items which the Scrum team must tackle.

**Product owner** - An individual who identifies product features, requirements, and prioritize them in bussiness needs order.

**ScrumMaster** - ensures that the Scrum process is followed by all the rules.

**Velocity**  - An estimate of how much product backlog effort that a team can cover in a single sprint. 

**Scrum sprint cycle**

During sprint the dev team is isolated from customers and organization. 
The only communication channel is Scrum Master who protects dev team from external distractions

<h3>Scaling agile methods</h3>
Agile has proofed to be successful for small/medium sized projects that is developed by small co-located team.

**Scaling up** - is concerned with using agile methods for developing large systems that couldn't be developed by small team

**Scalling out** - is concerned with how are agile methods can be introduced across a large organization.

**Agile for big projects**:
- Agile methods are incompatible for large projects. 
- Agile developed systems are suffering from lack of maintainability because of poor documentation, keeping customers involved, maintaining the continuity of dev team.
