<h2>Agile development</h2>
 - Program specification, design and implementation are inter-leaved 
 - The system is developed as a series of versions or increments with stakeholders involved in version specification and evaluation 
 - Frequent delivery of new versions for evaluation 
 - Extensive tool support (e.g. automated testing tools) used to support development. 
 - Minimal documentation – focus on working code

<h3>Agile Development Techniques</h3>
**Extreme Programming**
- A very influential agile method, developed in the late 1990s, that introduced a range of agile development techniques.
- Extreme Programming (XP) takes an ‘extreme’ approach to iterative development.
	- New versions may be built several times per day; 
	- Increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks; 
	- All tests must be run for every build and the build is only accepted if tests run successfully.
