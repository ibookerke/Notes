Multiprogramming isÂ **a rudimentary form of parallel processing in which several programs run at the same time on a uniprocessor system**.

However, because there is only one processor, there is no true simultaneous execution of different programs.

Multiprogramming organizes jobs (code and data) so CPU always has one to execute
A subset of total jobs in system is kept in memory 
One job is selected and run.
