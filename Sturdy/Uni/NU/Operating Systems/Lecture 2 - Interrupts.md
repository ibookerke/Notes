# OS 

Kernel - runs all the time on computer

Everything else are:
system programs and application programs

## 2 main definitions
OS - resource allocator
OS - is a control program

## [[User mode]] vs [[Kernel mode]]

Dual-mode operation allows OS to protect itself and other systems.
Realized using [[Mode bit]]


Some instructions designated as privileged, only executable in kernel mode

# Modern Os features 

## [[Multiprogramming]]

## [[Timesharing(Multitasking)]]

# Closed source vs open Source

- Operating systems made available in source-code format rather than just binary closed-source.
- Counter to the copy protection and Digital Rights Management (DRM) movement
- Started by Free Software Foundation (FSF), which has “copyleft” GNU Public License (GPL)


# Linux

An operating system developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
Dominant OS in servers, embedded devices, and mobile devices

## [[GNU]]/Linux Architecture

# Computer architecture
One or more CPUs, device controllers connect through common bus providing access to shared memory 
- Each device controller is in charge of a particular device type 
- Each device controller has a local buffer 
- CPU moves data from/to main memory to/from local buffers 
- I/O is from the device to local buffer of controller

# Interrupts 
[[Interrupt]] is an usually electrical signal sent to the CPU by external devices, typically I/O devices (controllers). They tell the CPU to stop its current activities and execute the appropriate part of the operating system.

There are three types of interrupts: 
- ==Hardware Interrupts== are generated by hardware devices to signal that they need some attention from the OS. They may have just received some data (e.g., keystrokes on the keyboard or an data on the Ethernet card); or they have just completed a task which the operating system previous requested, such as transferring data between the hard drive and memory. 
- ==Software Interrupts== are generated by programs when they want to request a system call to be performed by the operating system. 
- ==Traps== are generated by the CPU itself to indicate that some error or condition occurred for which assistance from the operating system is needed.
