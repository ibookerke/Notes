The proof-of-work system is the original algorithm in a blockchain network used by Bitcoin, among other popular crypto coins.

How Bitcoin applies it:
In this consensus algorithm, [miners](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/bitcoin-mining/) must solve complex equations using specialized computer equipment. The first miner to solve an equation correctly earns the right to add a block of transactions and earn rewards. If you don't produce the correct data, you've spent time and energy for nothing.


Proof of work (PoW) is **a form of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) proves to others (the verifiers) that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended**. Verifiers can subsequently confirm this expenditure with minimal effort on their part.

So, in order for hackers to add malicious disinformation to a blockchain, they need the 51% of verifiers to verify incorrect data, which is almost impossible to achieve.
