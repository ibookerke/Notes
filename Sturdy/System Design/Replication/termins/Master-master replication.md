- **Description**: All nodes in the system can act as a master, allowing both reads and writes.
- **Characteristics**:
    - Changes made to one node are replicated to others.
    - Allows simultaneous writes across multiple nodes.
- **Use Case**: Multi-region systems with low latency requirements.
- **Challenges**:
    - Conflict resolution is necessary when multiple nodes modify the same data.
    - Increased complexity compared to master-slave replication.
